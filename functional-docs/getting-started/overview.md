Understand the building blocks of Syneca before diving into detailed process documentation.

## Modules

Syneca is composed of modular capabilities that can be deployed independently or as an integrated suite. Each module surfaces end-to-end workflows designed for specific personas.

- **Customer Management** — Track accounts, contacts, and activity history in one workspace.
- **Engagement Automation** — Configure targeted journeys and messaging campaigns with built-in analytics.
- **Service Operations** — Resolve customer requests using unified queues, knowledge content, and SLA monitoring.

## Release Cadence

Product increments ship on a quarterly schedule with monthly maintenance releases. Functional documentation is versioned with each major release, making it simple for business teams to understand what changed and how to adopt it.
